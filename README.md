# 🥷 Code Senpai  

**Your AI-Powered Coding Mentor for Sei Blockchain**  
_Learn, build, and ship faster on Sei with an intelligent chatbot and VSCode extension._  

---

## 📌 Overview  

Building on a new blockchain ecosystem like **Sei** is exciting but also **painful**:  
- Documentation is scattered.  
- Resources are outdated.  
- Learning curves are steep for both new and experienced developers.  

**Code Senpai** solves this by acting as a **knowledgeable AI mentor**.  
Powered by a **chatbot interface + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model**, it understands **all Sei blockchain docs, tooling, and ecosystem projects**, helping developers quickly learn, troubleshoot, and ship production-grade projects.  

With a **VSCode extension (in development)** and a **chat-first developer experience**, Code Senpai becomes the **go-to coding companion** for anyone building on Sei.

## ⚡ Problem  

- 📄 **Fragmented Documentation** – Sei docs, tutorials, GitHub repos, and ecosystem projects are spread across multiple sources.  
- 🧩 **Steep Learning Curve** – Developers must understand Sei-specific modules, smart contract frameworks, and infrastructure quirks.  
- ⏳ **Slow Onboarding** – It takes days/weeks to become productive, slowing ecosystem growth.  
- ❌ **No Context-Aware Help** – Existing copilots (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) lack **Sei-specific knowledge**.  

---

## ✅ Solution: Code Senpai  

- 🤖 **Chatbot with RAG** – Conversational AI trained on Sei docs, repos, tutorials, and ecosystem projects.  
- 🧑‍💻 **VSCode Extension** – Context-aware suggestions, in-editor Q&A, and Sei-specific code snippets.  
- 📚 **Knowledge Hub** – One-stop solution for contracts, SDKs, APIs, and ecosystem integrations.  
- ⏱ **Always-on Mentor** – Answers questions like:  
  - _“How do I deploy on Sei testnet?”_  
  - _“What are Sei’s token standards?”_  
  - _“Show me a sample AMM smart contract.”_

## 🌍 Market Opportunity  

- **Developer Growth** – Sei is rapidly onboarding devs; frictionless tools accelerate adoption.  
- **Web3 DevTooling Gap** – No Sei-native AI assistant exists.  
- **Expanding Ecosystem** – As Sei’s DeFi, gaming, and infra projects grow, ecosystem-aware tools become critical.  

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**  
- 🌐 Blockchain devs globally (2025 est.): **~1M active devs**.  
- 🎯 Sei-specific: **Thousands onboarding in next 12 months**.  
- 📈 Expansion potential: Multi-chain support beyond Sei.
